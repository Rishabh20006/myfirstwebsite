   <div style="position: relative; top: -20px;"><p>Hello, Welcome to KnowledgEmpire <br>
Here you will know from where to start and begin your journey in coding and programming. <br>
So to start journey in coding and programming you should know a computer language. <br>
Best languages to begin start with is HTML,CSS,Javascript and Python. <br>
Javascript,CSS and HTML are used together. So we can directly say <br> Javascript and Pyhton. </p></div> 
<h1>Computer languages</h1>
<p style="position: relative; top: -20px;" id="p5">So,guys computer languaes are language which we use to give instructions <br>
to computer. <br>
One of the most popular Computer languages are as follows: <br>
1.Python <br> 2.Javascript <br> 3.Java <br> 4.C++  <br> 5.C<br></p></div>
<h1 style="position: relative; top: -50px;">Definations</h1>

<div style="position: relative; top: -67px;"> 1.Python:Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. <br> Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of <br> significant whitespace. <br><br>
2.Javascript: JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that <br> conforms to the ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time <br> compiled, and multi-paradigm.It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, <br> prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.  <br><br>  
3.Java: Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language <br> that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. <br><br>
4.C++: C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup <br> as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". <br><br>
5.C: C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language <br> supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. <br> By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
